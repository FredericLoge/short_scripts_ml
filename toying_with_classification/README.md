In **recoding_logreg.R**: we code logistic regression with application on the IRIS dataset.

In **recoding_lda.R**: we code LDA with application on simulated data. Shows on the IRIS dataset how to do a projection on a subspace in a supervised way.

In **iris_dataset.R**: we study the IRIS data, which is an easy ML problem. The algorithms used are: logistic regression, LDA & KNN. LR works fine, so do the others. PCA allows to summarize the space by conserving a large amount of variance, but deteriorates heavily our performance capabilities.

In **titanic_dataset.R**: TITANIC is a more difficult problem than IRIS, we investigate LR, LDA, Breiman Trees and Breiman Random Forest. This example stands as a case where the variability is too important for good accuracy and where most methods perform rather evenly.
